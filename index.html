                Student</p>
            <p>I am a junior in Computer Engineering and Mathematics at Iowa State University. I have completed an
                internship at Vermeer Corporation during the summer of 2024, in which I was an Embedded Software
                Engineering Intern. This next summer, (2025), I will be a Software Engineering Intern at Workiva. Read
                on to learn about some of the projects I have worked on!</p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using only two technologies: HTML and CSS.
                    The project consists of creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as the Navigation
                    Bar. We
                    have to include text describing ourself and text describing the project. Additionally, we need to
                    include two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything related to the project
                    itself.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>The second project was created during a semester-long class studying software development practices.
                    I was a frontend developer, so I designed the user interface and utilized REST API requests to
                    access the database. My end of the project was designed on Android Studio. We also learned about
                    GitHub version control practices. The app that my team and I created was a simple generative
                    obstacle shooter game.

                <h3>Project 3</h3>
                <p>The third project was designed during my summer internship at Vermeer Corporation. I, along with
                    another intern, created an internal tool using Python and various libraries to access machine data.
                    The project would filter, clean, and display said data to company stakeholders within a simple,
                    interactive application.

                <h3>Project 4</h3>
                <p>The fourth project is currently being worked on in my Computer Architecture and Assembly Level
                    Programming class. During the semester, we will be designing our own procesors, using MIPS Assembly,
                    and VHDL. We will design two different processors and compare the strengths and weaknesses of the
                    two designs.
